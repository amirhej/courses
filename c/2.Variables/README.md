# Variable

Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.
In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords):

+ `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as `123` or `-123`.
+ `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as `19.99` or `-19.99`.
+ `char` - stores single characters, such as `'a'` or `'B'`. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.

## Declaring

To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:
```
type variableName = value;
```
The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable.
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later.

## Output Value & Format Specifiers

In many other programming languages (like [Python](https://github.com/amirhej/courses/tree/main/python), Java, and C++), you would normally use a print function to display the value of a variable. However, this is not possible in C.

Format specifiers are used together with the `printf()` function to tell the compiler what type of data the variable is storing. It is basically a placeholder for the variable value.

A format specifier starts with a percentage sign `%`, followed by a character:

+ `%d` or `%i`  -->	 `int`	
+ `%f` --> `float`	
+ `%lf` -->	`double`	
+ `%c` --> `char`	
+ `%s` -->	Used for strings (text), which you will learn more about in a later chapter

+ To output the value of an `int` variable, you must use the format specifier `%d` or `%i` surrounded by double quotes, inside the `printf()` function.

+ To print other types, use `%c` for `char` and `%f` for `float`.

## Changing

If you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value.

You can also assign the value of one variable to another or copy values to empty variables.

## Add Together

To add a variable to another variable, you can use the `+` operator.

## Declare Multiple Variables

To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list.

You can also assign the same value to multiple variables of the same type.

## Variable Names

All C variables must be identified with unique names. these unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

### General Rules

+ Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
+ Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`)
+ Names are case sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different variables)
+ Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like `!`, `#`, `%`, etc.
+ Reserved words (such as `int`) cannot be used as names

## Data Types
A variable in C must be a specified data type, and you must use a format specifier inside the printf() function to display it.

### Basic Data Types

* `int`	  __2 or 4 bytes__	  Stores whole numbers, without decimals
* `float`   __4 bytes__	  Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
* `double`	__8 bytes__	  Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
* `char`	__1 byte__	Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values

## Set Decimal Precision

If you want to remove the extra zeros (set decimal precision), you can use a dot (.) followed by a number that specifies how many digits that should be shown after the decimal point.
