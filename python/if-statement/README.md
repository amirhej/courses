# IF statement

## Definition:

Some conditional execution will be done with the help of this instruction.

```
if condition:
    doSomething()
    .
    .
    .
elif other_condition:
    doSomethingElse()
    .
    .
else:
    doOtherwisejob()
    .

```

## Logical:

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:


+ Equals: `a == b`

+ Not Equals: `a != b`

+ Less than: `a < b`

+ Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

+ Greater than: `a > b`

+ Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`


## Indentation:

Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

## Elif:

if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition.

# Else:

catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

## Short Hand If:

If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the `if` statement.

## Ternary Operators ( Conditional Expressions ):

if you have only one statement to execute, one for `if`, and one for `else`, you can put it all on the same line.

## And:

is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements.
` and `

## Or:

is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements.
` or `

## Nested If:

You can have `if` statements inside `if` statements, this is called nested `if` statements.

## The pass Statement:

`if` statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an `if` statement with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.
